Starting website:
-npm start in terminal (visual code)
-open http://localhost:3000 


1. Creating new page (example with Register page)

- add <Route path="/register" component={RegisterPage} /> to app/containers/app/index.js
- add folder RegisterPage to containers 
- add index.js and Loadable.js to folder above
- after some time I see that it's simpler to cust copy HomePage folder in app/containers and raname folder then every name, class etc
- add to app/components/header/index.js hyperlink to Register page
- change "HomePage.propTypes =" to "RegisterPage.propTypes =" (propTypes : https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)
- copy client\internals\templates\containers\HomePage to containers folder and rename everything accordinly (probably need to debugging RegisterPage but not sure, to confirm)



2. Adding bootstrap
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/buttons/

- "npm install --save bootstrap" in main folder in console
- add link to bootstrap in index.html 

3. If you have error message: "'cross-env' is not recognized as an internal or external command," after trying to start project do this:
- go to client folder and run:
- npm clean cache --force
- npm install
- npm start
